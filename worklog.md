Just a note:
really like the "f*ck it up all the way and then do it for real" approach to creating stuff
90% of the time it's faster to f*ck up and know why than it is to think about all the ways you might f*ck up

100% agree: I code like I write my music. I dont sit and make notes on paper, I sit at the synth and tinker, make some sounds, 
twiddle knobs, play some chords, feel the music, keep it or trash it, get feedback and iterate. totally get your jam. im with you.
